# Guru (Mementor)

This is the final project from the apprentices from October to January 2019-20, this tool allows a better overview on the mentor/mentee relationship and track the meeting that they are having.

## Tech stack

Front-End:
- React.js
- Jest and Enzyme

Infrastructure:
- AWS
    - EB
    - RDS

## Build

To build the project in your localhost, you need to 
build the `front-end` application to package it. After this we package 
our `back-end`, and then run our `.jar` file.

to do this run the `localdeploy.sh` file.

Now you can go to http://localhost:8080/ and the app will be deployed.

_note that this steps can be found in the Dockerfile._

## Frontend dev development

If you're only working on the frontend, you won't need to redeploy the entire application on every change.
You can deploy the backend one and start a dev server that will hot reload the frontend code for you.

- `./localdeploy.sh`
- `npm --prefix front-end start`

The app will now be accessible on http://localhost:3000

## AWS Deployment

In order to deploy to AWS from your local machine, you need to run `aws configure` and setup the credentials that can
be found on BitWarden.  
Then you can run the deploy script:

`./deploy-aws.sh integ`
